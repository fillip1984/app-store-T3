# Application Store

I have a tendency to bound around on projects and can't remember where I used some technique or some library. This tool will hopefully allow for me to document which applications I'm working on and more importantly what tech I'm using in each application.

## Speaking of which

I'm abandoning this version for now since T3 is fighting me every step of the way and I'm trying to move fast right now and not learn it. Will return when I have more time to learn the library.

Breaking point was when I was trying to use React Hook Form and the SubmitHandler was complaining that I wasn't supplying the proper fields when I'm only trying to send a partial. Even when I set the SubmitHandler to Partial<Application> I was still getting errors. T3 looks interesting but is pretty darn strict and I'm not finding the time to work through its rigor!
